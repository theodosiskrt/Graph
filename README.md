A simple plot application I created using Plotly and Material UI, as well as redux for the management of some parts of the state.

To run the application open a terminal inside the graph directory and run the following commands:
-npm install
-npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
-npm start

And the application should be running on port 3000!
